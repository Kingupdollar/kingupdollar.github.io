			<h1>Step 03: Serve the boba tea</h1>
			<p>Now that we have the boba milk tea, we may serve it and enjoy...not so fast! You will need to be careful of some detals before serving it to the table:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Skill 1:</b> Adding ice<br>
					Having the boba tea in room temperature is totally a <em>cult!</em> Never try to do that. It is not an authentic way to have boba tea.</li><br>
				<li><b>Skill 2:</b> Adding a wide straw<br>
					Sucking the pearls with the straw is an indespensable experience while having boba tea. Thus, remember to use a <em>wide straw!</em></li>
			</ol>
