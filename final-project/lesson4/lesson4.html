	  <p>Retinal detachment can be mitigated in some cases when the warning signs are caught early. The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggesting a posterior vitreous detachment.<br><br>
Early examination allows detection of retinal tears which can be treated with laser surgery or cryotherapy. This reduces the risk of retinal detachment in those who have tears from around 1:3 to 1:20. For this reason, the governing bodies in some sports require regular eye examination.<br><br>
If the retina is detached already, it will need to take other surgeries, such as scleral buckle or vitreous, to push the retina back to its original position and enclose the break on the retina.<br><br>
Scleral buckle surgery is an established treatment in which the eye surgeon sews one or more silicone bands to the sclera (the white outer coat of the eyeball). The bands push the wall of the eye inward against the retinal hole, closing the break or reducing fluid flow through it and reducing the effect of vitreous traction thereby allowing the retina to re-attach. This is a relative safer and the most commonly-used retinal detachment surgery with its successful rate being up to 90%. However, since it is a band wrapped on the sclera, this treatment can only be conducted once on each eyeball.<br><br>
If recurrent retinal detachment happens and the scleral buckle surgery has already been conducted, it is possible to conduct another type of surgery called vitrectomy. Vitrectomy is another commonly-used treatment for retinal detachment. It involves the removal of the vitreous gel and is usually combined with filling the eye with either a gas bubble or silicone oil. The surface tension of the gas/water interface seals the hole in the retina, and suck the retina back into place. The Vitrectomy can be applied to recurrent retinal detachment. However, it is more complex and dangerous than the scleral buckle surgery, so it would not be the first choice if the situation allows.</p>

      <p>Question 1:<br>Consider the situation of the following patient and determine which will be the suitable treatment in this case:
Patient A is detected to have retinal tears. There are some breaks on the peripheral of his retina. However, his retina is not yet detached.</p>
